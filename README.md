# Utility Functions for Django Analysis

This package incorporates all functions created and used for the Django and Jupyter analysis. Install it using pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/yancyvance/django-analysis.git`

The analysis mainly uses Django in Jupyter instead of the other way around.

This is a work in progress.
